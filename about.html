				<h4>Our Philosophy</h4>
				<p>In this day and age, technology should, well, "just work." There's no reason users should have to remember dozens of passwords for their day-to-day work.
                                  Updating your website should take seconds, and never require complicated technical jargon. Connecting to social media sites should take just a click of
                                  a button. Similarly, IT departments shouldn't have to tackle all these problems from 20 different vendors whose systems can't communicate with each other.
                                  At Syndetics, LLC, we'll turn your IT service nightmares into a cloud service heaven.</p>
