						<p>IT has never been simple -- with each new technology adopted by the enterprise, IT environments have become more complex, while provisioning and managing the application infrastructure drove up costs. The expected benefits of new technology are often never realized because IT groups lacked tools to make implementing new technologies efficient and cost effective. Clickloud's software handles management and provisioning of complex systems that empower IT groups to deliver applications at a faster pace.</p>
						<p>The Click Cloud Server gives your IT organization the ability to:</p>
						<p>
							<span class="fix-this">Rapidly model and provision application infrastructure</span>
							<span class="fix-this">Automate changes to the system deployment process</span>
							<span class="fix-this">Efficiently utilize internal, external, and virtualized IT resources on demand</span>
							<span class="fix-this">Enforce IT policy rules</span>

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s.</p>
